# *Hasmath*: Mathematical Code Snippets in Haskell [![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT_(Expat)-yellow?logo=spdx&logoColor=white)](./LICENSE)

I wrote most of these modules when I was learning the basics of Haskell, in
mid-2020, some of which are incomplete.   I am entering it now into version
control to keep a registry of all my personal projects on a hosting system.

## Usage

This is by no  means a complete and usable library;  therefore, I would not
advise the  usage of  this package  in a larger  program, there  are better
libraries available for Haskell.

To use a particular module in an interactive prompt the recommended is to

*  `ghci   src/`*`MODULE`*`/`*`SUBMODULE`*`.hs`  for   a  *MODULE*   and  a
  *SUBMODULE*, or,

* `ghci src/`*`SOURCE`*`.hs`  if the haskell *SOURCE* file is  not inside a
  module.
